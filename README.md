## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=2.18.6)
- Firebase account
- Platform-specific development environment (Android Studio, Xcode, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yeong_mood_tracker.git
   cd yeong_mood_tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**

   This project requires Firebase configuration files that are excluded from version control for security.
